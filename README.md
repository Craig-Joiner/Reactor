⚡ Reactor – A Simple, Clean System Monitor

Reactor is a lightweight system monitoring app for Windows, inspired by the elegant UI and functional approach of NZXT CAM. This project was built to offer real-time insights into your system's core performance metrics—CPU, RAM, and storage—within a clean and modern interface.
🚀 Features

    CPU Monitoring
    See real-time CPU usage, core count, and processor name.

    RAM Monitoring
    Track total and used memory with live updates.

    Storage Info
    View all drives and their usage statistics in a sleek display.

    (GPU Monitoring coming soon)

💡 Inspiration

I’ve always liked the aesthetic and utility of NZXT CAM, but wanted something custom and more lightweight. Reactor was born from that idea—a project focused on simplicity, clarity, and performance.

🛠️ Tech Stack

    .NET (WPF)

    MVVM Architecture

    C#

    DispatcherTimers for live updates

🧠 Learnings

This project was a hands-on deep dive into WPF data binding, MVVM architecture, and performance optimization using DispatcherTimer. It was also a fun UI/UX challenge to keep things clean and readable like CAM.
